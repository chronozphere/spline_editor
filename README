Hi,

This is my spline-editor programmed in pascal using Lazarus 0.9.30 and FreePascal 2.4.2
It is released under the "new BSD license" and is found to be working on both 
Windows and Ubuntu.

Features include:
> WYSIWYG Spline creation and manipuation
> True 3D splines that can be seen from front/side/top view
> Up-vectors that denote "what is up", can be defined using angles with respect 
to the positive Y axis.
> Move or Scale your splines to make them fit into any 3D world
> Load and save your splines to a simple XML format

I hope you will find this program usefull. :)

Enjoy!
